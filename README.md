# Tic Tac Toe Game

In this project, you'll build a functional, two-person Tic Tac Toe game. You'll use the provided mockups, HTML, CSS 
and image files to create a game that requires players to add their names, take turns adding an X or O to the game 
board, and announce when the game ends. You'll need to keep track of the state of the game -- whose turn it is, 
where the X's and O's are on the board, and whether the game is a draw or, if not, who won and lost.  

Use the module pattern to create your Tic-Tac-Toe game.  

## Project Instructions

**Use the supplied mockup files and HTML snippets to guide you in building a Tic Tac Toe game. You can use jQuery or 
plain JavaScript to complete this project. Don't use an already programmed Tic Tac Toe plugin or library.**  

**When the page loads, the startup screen should appear. Use the `tictactoe-01-start.png` mockup, and the `start.txt` 
HTML snippet to guide you.**

**Add programming, so that when the player clicks the start button the start screen disappears, the board appears, 
and the game begins. Use the `tictactoe-02-inprogress.png` mockup, and the `board.txt` HTML snippet to guide you.**  

**Add the game play following these rules:**

* Play alternates between X and O.  

* The current player is indicated at the top of the page -- the box with the symbol O or X is highlighted for the 
current player. You can do this by simply adding the class `.active` to the proper list item in the HTML. For 
example, if it's player one's turn, the HTML should look like this: `<li class="players active" id="player1">`

* When the current player mouses over an empty square on the board, it's symbol the X or O should appear on the 
square. You can do this using the `x.svg` or `o.svg` graphics (hint use JavaScript to set the background-image 
property for that box.)

* Players can only click on empty squares. When the player clicks on an empty square, attach the class 
`box-filled-1` (for O) or `box-filled-2` (for X) to the square. The CSS we're providing will automatically add the 
proper image to the square marking it as occupied.

* The game ends when one player has three of their symbols in a row either horizontally, vertically or 
diagonally. If all of the squares are filled and no players have three in a row, the game is a tie.  

**Add programming so that when the game ends, the board disappears and the game end screen appears. Use the 
`tictactoe-03-winner1.png` and `tictactoe-04-winner2.png` mockups, and the `win.txt` HTML snippet for guidance. 
Depending on the game results the final screen should:**  

* Show the word "Winner" or the phrase "It's a Tie!"

* Add the appropriate class to the `<div>` for the winning screen: `<div class="screen screen-win" id="finish">` 
`screen-win-one` for player 1, `screen-win-two` for player two, or `screen-win-tie` if the game ends with no 
winner. For example, if player 1 wins, the HTML should look like this: `<div class="screen screen-win 
screen-win-one" id="finish">`

**Add programming so that when a player pushes the "New Game" button, the board appears again, empty, and a 
new game begins.**


## Extra Credit

**On the start screen, prompt the user add their name before the game starts**

**Display the player’s name on the board screen during game play**

**Add programming to support playing against the computer. Only one player plays; the other is controlled by 
your programming.**

**Display the player’s name if they win the game**
